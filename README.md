# Beauty Salon Database
I created a database for a beauty salon that contains four __tables__: clients, employees, appointments and services.  
Within this homework, I used data definition language, data manipulation and data query language __instructions__.  
Furthermore, I've put into practice the concept of __table relationships__ and __primary key, foreign key__.
